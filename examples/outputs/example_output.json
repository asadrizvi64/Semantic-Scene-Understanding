      "answer": "Character B appears surprised in response to Character A's revelation that they've 'discovered something that changes everything.' This statement carries significant emotional weight and implies a dramatic shift in circumstances, which naturally triggers Character B's surprise. The surprise is also intensified by Character A's nervous demeanor leading up to this revelation, creating anticipation and tension.",
